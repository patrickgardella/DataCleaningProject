Naming Strategy
---------------

The variable names in the original dataset have been altered to make them more readable and compiant with the R programming language standards.  The varialbes have had all symbols ("-", "(", and ")") removed, and the words expanded to be more udnerstandable. Additionally, due to the length of the variables, "camelCase" is used to make them more readable.

For instance, *tBodyAcc-mean()-Y* has been transformed into *tBodyAccelerometerMeanYAxis*.

However, both the "t" and the "f" prefixes have been retained. A "t" prefix indicates that the variable is in the time domain, while an "f" indicates frequency domain, as obtainted through a Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT).

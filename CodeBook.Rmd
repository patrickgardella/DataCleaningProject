Title
========================================================

In my CodeBook I will provide a detailed description of the variables, activity labels, my naming strategy, variable selection method, and notation. I am not sure of the value of including detailed descriptions of the meaning and interpretation of each of the many variables that I included. I think it is safer to explain the correspondence and transformations that were applied and link to the original documentation / citation materials (since my dataset and analysis script are both entirely dependent upon it).

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```

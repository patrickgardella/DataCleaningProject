<h2>Original Dataset</h2>

<p>The original source of the data for this project is taken from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0 as compiled by:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<h2>Naming Strategy</h2>

<p>The variable names in the original dataset have been altered to make them more readable and compiant with the R programming language standards.  The varialbes have had all symbols (&ldquo;-&rdquo;, &ldquo;(&rdquo;, and &ldquo;)&rdquo;) removed, and the words expanded to be more udnerstandable. Additionally, due to the length of the variables, &ldquo;camelCase&rdquo; is used to make them more readable.</p>

<p>For instance, <em>tBodyAcc-mean()-Y</em> has been transformed into <em>tBodyAccelerometerMeanYAxis</em>.</p>

<p>However, both the &ldquo;t&rdquo; and the &ldquo;f&rdquo; prefixes have been retained. A &ldquo;t&rdquo; prefix indicates that the variable is in the time domain, while an &ldquo;f&rdquo; indicates frequency domain, as obtainted through a Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT).</p>
